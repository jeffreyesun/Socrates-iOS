"Uber for tutors," Socrates is a mobile app that a friend and I developed (he did the business, I did the tech) last summer, after realizing that the way tutors and tutees were finding each other was still by posting physical sheets of paper around campus, as though we had just invented fire and the internet was but a twinkling in Al Gore's eye.

This repository is the minimum viable product (depending on whether or not our Firebase account is still active) where tutors can make profiles, which can be fetched and viewed by anyone who downloads the app.

#Core Features

##Profiles
![Tutor map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffreyesun/Socrates/master/images/profiledown.png)

Tutors make profiles, listing areas of expertise, their fee, contact information, and a short bio about themselves

##Tutor List

Anyone who downloads the app can access a list of tutors.

Tutors can choose whether they want their profiles to be always visible, or only visible when they "check in."

##Tutor Map

Instead of viewing the tutors as a list, users can view the locations of currently online tutors in real-time on a map of their area. Developed with the Google Maps API, not yet integrated.

This is the iOS version.
